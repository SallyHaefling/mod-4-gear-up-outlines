  Name of your Gear Up Presentation: Using Tech For Good
  
  - Talking points for your presentation: Discuss overview of what smarthomes are in relation to someone with a developmental and/or physical disability
  - Talk about the history of smart homes 
  - Speak about devices, cover the benefits of each device for a smart home: shades/curtains can be helpful for people with cerebral palsy or people who do not have hands or arms. Colored notification lights are used by people with hearing impairments  - using various colors based off of different scenarios such as blue for laundry, red for food being done, etc., smart doorbells are used by people with hearing impairments causing their phone to blink and allowing a camera for them to see who the person is at the door, voice controlled home entertainment systems that allow people with vision impairments to change the tv channel with voice commands, etc., Smarthubs that allow people with vision impairments to have their alarm clock set, hear a summary of the latest news, and more, Talkitt is an app that allows people with speech impediments to talk into the device and it translates unintelligable pronunciations into understandable speech - the device works in any language
  - Where I used to work: talk about how I used to work at a company that built a smarthome for the individuals we worked with and how this benefited their quality of life and independence for example, not having to rely on caregivers for everything and instead feeling empowered to do it on their own, residents could press switches with their heads to interact with their devices, and all 6 residents can control lighting, shades, fan, tv, phone, and website access - something they used to have to rely on from caregivers. Additionally, every resident can participate in food prep and cooking because all counters and appliances are ADA compliant and the stove shuts off immediately when not in use.
 - Read quote and talk about how it came from the IBM training manual
 - Conclusion, talk about how I'd love for people to walk away with more understanding of our able bodied privelege  
...as a dev, should be thinking about accessibility in a different way than some of the ways we discuss at Turing

  
  2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:
    1. What does this information teach us about able-bodied/able minded privilege? 
    2. How can you make an impact on this population by being a software developer? 
    3. What are some possible arguments you can make for AND against smart homes and devices(hint: lack of consent in some situations due to inability to communicate in ways that others might not understand)?
